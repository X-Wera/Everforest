# Everforest

Everforest is a top down open world exploration game.
Game play will be heavily inspired by the original Diablo game and it's random generation of the dungeons.
Starting in a base that is built by the player. That can be left at any time to explore the Forest.
In the forest you will get lost very easily. Earn experience. Explore. Meet new friends.
And most importantly get wicked awesome swag.
My goal is to finish it by the end of 2021
